//In this example, using auto would infer a type of const char*. C-style strings arenâ€™t easy to work
//with (apart from using operator[]). In this case, we prefer to explicitly define the parameter as
//a std::string_view, which allows us to work with the underlying data much more easily (e.g.
//we can ask the string view for its length, even if the user passed in a C-style array).
