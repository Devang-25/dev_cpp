    //If you want to provide lambdas with mutable captured variables, pass them by reference using
    //std::ref.

//Best practice

//Try to avoid lambdas with states altogether. Stateless lambdas are easier to understand
// and donâ€™t suffer from the above issues, as well as more dangerous issues that arise when
//you add parallel execution.
